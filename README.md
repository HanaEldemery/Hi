# University Advising Students' Database Management System
I created a comprehensive database system to manage student advising, course registration, payments, and various administrative functions. 
To start, I created a new database that served as the foundation for all subsequent tasks, including the creation of various tables and stored procedures.
The first set of tasks involved developing stored procedures for table management. I implemented a stored procedure named CreateAllTables to create all necessary tables with their respective definitions. Each table was designed to handle specific aspects of the advising system, such as students, courses, instructors, payments, and exams. Another stored procedure, DropAllTables, was created to drop all tables from the database, ensuring a clean slate if needed. Additionally, a stored procedure named ClearAllTables was designed to clear all records from existing tables without dropping them, which helps in resetting the data without affecting the schema.
Next, I focused on data retrieval by creating several views to fetch and display data based on specific criteria. The view_Students view was implemented to fetch details of all active students, providing a quick overview of the current student population. The view_Course_prerequisites view fetched details of all courses along with their prerequisites, ensuring that prerequisite information was easily accessible. Another view, Instructors_AssignedCourses, displayed details of all instructors along with their assigned courses, making it easier to manage instructor-course assignments. The Student_Payment view provided details of all payments along with their corresponding students, helping to track financial transactions. The Courses_Slots_Instructor view combined course, slot, and instructor details into a single table, facilitating scheduling and resource management. The Courses_MakeupExams view listed all courses along with their makeup exam details, ensuring that information about exam schedules was readily available. The Students_Courses_transcript view compiled student course history, including grades and instructors, for a comprehensive academic record. The Semster_offered_Courses view listed all semesters along with their offered courses, aiding in semester planning. Finally, the Advisors_Graduation_Plan view detailed graduation plans along with their initiated advisors, supporting academic advising processes.
In addition to views, I developed several stored procedures to handle various administrative functions. These included procedures for student and advisor registration, listing students and advisors, adding semesters and courses, linking instructors to courses, linking students to courses and advisors, adding exams, issuing installments, deleting courses and slots, and updating student statuses based on financial information. Each procedure was designed to facilitate specific tasks within the advising system, ensuring that all administrative needs were met efficiently.
Moreover, I created functions to handle login processes for both students and advisors, as well as functions to retrieve specific data such as pending requests, available courses, graduation plans, upcoming installments, and slots for courses taught by specific instructors. These functions enhanced the functionality of the advising system, providing necessary tools for both students and advisors to manage their academic and administrative activities.
Overall, the work involved a comprehensive set of tasks to create a robust database system capable of managing the various aspects of student advising, course registration, payments, and administration. By implementing these stored procedures, views, and functions, I ensured that the system could handle all required operations efficiently and effectively.
This helped build my understanding and skills in several key areas. It enhanced my proficiency in SQL, including writing complex queries, creating stored procedures, and designing views. These skills are fundamental for any database-related tasks and are crucial for managing and manipulating data efficiently.
